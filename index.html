		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			<p>REM is the stage of sleep where dreams are created. For many small businesses, COVID-19 has been an absolute nightmare.Small businesses  are struggling to stay open and face significant problems attracting, engaging and retaining customers.  Now more than ever, they need support. </p>
		<h2 id = "main">Mission</h2>
			<p>At Rem and Company, we're on a mission to keep doors open and dreams alive. We began by offering free consulting services to small businesses impacted by COVID-19. Through industry research and working with clients, we expanded to meet the needs of our clients and grew into an information hub and digital community platform for small businesses. </p>

		<h2>Community</h2>
		<p>
			At the University of Michigan chapter we focus on supporting female and minority owned local businesses across Ann Arbor and Detroit. Founded in 2020, we have been able to expand to a team of over 40 Rembers.</p>
		<h2>Services</h2>
			<p>Our expertise lies in understanding the consumer, particularly those who are digitally savvy. COVID-19 has caused a digital acceleration and many small businesses have been thrown into a space where they do not fully understand the consumer or how to engage with them through social media or other digital platforms. This is a sphere where Gen Z and millennials dominate because of their purchasing power and the influence they exert over household spending. This translates into superior digital and financial knowledge that can effectively navigate times of disruption and uncertainty. They are the connection to the rest of the market and we are your connection to how to engage them . </p>
