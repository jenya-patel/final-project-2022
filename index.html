		<p>At Rem and Company, we're on a mission to keep doors open and dreams alive. We began by offering free consulting services to small businesses impacted by COVID-19. Through industry research and working with clients, we expanded to meet the needs of our clients and grew into an information hub and digital community platform for small businesses. </p>
